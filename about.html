            <img id="about-image" alt="About Us" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 15px;">
            <p>Welcome to The Free Little Flower Stand, where our family has taken the saying “stop and smell the roses” quite literally—and then we give them away! This whole adventure started when Alyssa, who once doubted her flower-arranging and selling skills, realized that giving them away for free made everything bloom even brighter. With Barry’s full support (and muscle power for carrying those heavy vases), we’ve turned this into a full-blown joy-spreading operation.</p>
            <p>Our toddler Jax is the chief flower inspector, always ready to lend a hand (or two tiny ones) in cutting, arranging, and delivering bouquets with the precision only a three-year-old can master. Baby Kassadin might not be able to handle the shears just yet, but he’s already mastered the art of posing for the camera, adding that extra dose of cuteness to our floral displays. And our daughter Evelyn? She’s got a knack for romance, often sneaking off with a bouquet to surprise her girlfriend—keeping the love (and flowers) in full bloom.</p>
            <p>We believe that a simple act of kindness, like giving flowers, can make the world a little brighter. We want to make the world smile, whether you’re receiving a bouquet, seeing the photos online, or just enjoying the sight of them as you drive by; because here, the flowers are always free, and so is the happiness they bring.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being a part of our journey and for sharing in the joy.</p>
